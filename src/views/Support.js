        There is nobody that is still alive and breathing who has no purpose or
        nothing that God has enabled him/her to be able to help with. We might
        not all be able to help in a particular way, but we can all help in our
        unique way according to divine enablement and individual strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bearing the above in mind, God made it clear to us the various ways
        anybody who feels led can be of help.

          <h2>Pray for The Missionaries</h2>
          <p>
            The power of prayer is the greatest force on earth and we have no
            doubt about the efficacy of earnest, fervent prayers sent up to the
            throne of grace from a heart of faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can support the mission work by praying and it is no little work
            or sacrifice. In this regard, we ask for a committed and dedicated
            prayers for all that goes out into the field for the harvest of
            souls into the Kingdom of our Father.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is not a must, but we recommend that you set out a
            particular amount of time on a particular day (and even a particular
            place if you have the means) to pray specifically for Light City
            Int'l and all her missionary engagements.

          (Rom 10:14)Â  How then shall they call on him in whom they have not
          believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not
          heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
        </p>

          The greatest force for evangelism is humans for even the angel has to recommend Apostle Peter to Cornelius for salvation to be preached and achieved in the home of Cornelius.

          Like in a war, the missionaries are the boots on the battlefield and on the frontline. Who by the ministry of the Spirit and the instrument of the Word snatch people away from the grip of hell and darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          What a great privilege that God has called us mere men to come and partner with Him in saving mankind? No wonder the reward of them that heed this call are so great and they are exceedingly cherished by the Father.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humbly consider being part of the missionaries who have dedicated their lives to reaching the unreached.

          <h2>Pay for The Missionary Work</h2>
          <p>
            The movement of Missionaries from one place to another can be helped
            or hindered by the availability of money or the lack of it. The
            transportation, the feeding, the medical and other humanitarian
            service rendered at the mission field won't go well without
            sufficient funds to run them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having the above in mind, it is clear that being a financial partner
            of our missionary work is a very crucial and important support that
            you can give and we humbly request that you consider it generously.
