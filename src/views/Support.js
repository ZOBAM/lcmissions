        There is nobody that is still alive and breathing who has no purpose or
        nothing that God has enabled him/her to be able to help with. We might
        not all be able to help in a particular way, but we can all help in our
        unique way according to divine enablement and individual strength.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bearing the above in mind, God made it clear to us the various ways
        anybody who feels led can be of help.

          <h2>Pray for The Missionaries</h2>
          <p>
            The power of prayer is the greatest force on earth and we have no
            doubt about the efficacy of earnest, fervent prayers sent up to the
            throne of grace from a heart of faith.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can support the mission work by praying and it is no little work
            or sacrifice. In this regard, we ask for a committed and dedicated
            prayers for all that goes out into the field for the harvest of
            souls into the Kingdom of our Father.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it is not a must, but we recommend that you set out a
            particular amount of time on a particular day (and even a particular
            place if you have the means) to pray specifically for Light City
            Int'l and all her missionary engagements.
