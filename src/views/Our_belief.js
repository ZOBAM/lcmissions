          </li>
          <li>
            We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His virgin birth,
            HIs sinless life, His miracles, His bodily resurrection, His
            ascension to the right hand of the Father, His personal future
            return to this earth in power and glory to rule.

            Christ's second coming.

          <li>
            We believe that the only way to salvation is through Jesus Christ,
            faith in the finished work of Jesus on the cross.
          </li>
          <li>Regeneration by the Holy Spirit is essential for salvation.</li>
          <li>
            The redemptive work of Christ on the cross provides deliverance and
            healing for the body in response to prayer of faith.

          <li>
            The Baptism of the Holy Spirit according to Acts 2:4 is given to
            believers who ask for it with the evidence of speaking in tongues.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe in the sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit, by whose
            indwelling the Christian is able to live a holy life.
          </li>
          <li>
            We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost, the
            one to everlasting life and the other to everlasting damnation
